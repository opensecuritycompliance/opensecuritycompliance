## About ComplianceCow

With backing from Surface Ventures, Westwave Capital, Garuda Ventures, and more, ComplianceCow is the next big thing in the GRC space. ComplianceCow's tried, true, and agentic middleware enables you to automate Continuous Controls Monitoring on a depth and scale incomparable to the average GRC platform. Unlike traditional GRC platforms, ComplianceCow focuses on automating evidence at the control layer, not just managing tasks. We integrate with and augment all your favorite GRC platforms and organizational communications tools. We help teams reduce audit fatigue, shorten compliance cycles, and eliminate the hidden costs of manual evidence collection.

### For the more technical folks, what does that mean?

ComplianceCow's CCM turns control testing into a continuous signal. Machine-collected evidence and automated checks keep control status current across cloud, on-prem, and Kubernetes.

ComplianceCow is an API-first compliance automation platform that helps Security, GRC, and DevOps teams collect and verify evidence, such as policy settings, access controls, and config baselines, across hybrid cloud, on-prem, proprietary, and Kubernetes systems.

Being API-first means ComplianceCow fits cleanly into modern DevOps pipelines and custom environments, reducing friction for engineering teams.

We integrate with tools like GRC platforms, AWS, Jira, and Slack to enforce and monitor security controls, support leading frameworks like SOC 2 and ISO 27001, and enable Continuous Controls Monitoring (CCM) and audit assurance at scale.
