        "3.\t**Using IncludeCriteria:**\n",
        "\t- Example: `registry/registry1/repo/repo1/tag/latest`, `registry/registry1/repo/repo1/tag/*`, `registry/registry1/repo/*/tag/*`\n",
        "\t- This will include the specified repositories and tags in the scan.\n",

        "\t- Example: `registry/registry1/repo/repo1/tag/latest`\n",
        "\t- This will exclude the specified repositories and tags from the scan.\n",

        "\t-\tThe criteria matching is case-sensitive and requires an exact match unless wildcards are used.\n",
